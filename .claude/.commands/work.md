You will be provided with a GitHub issue containing the details needed to understand the scope and context. Follow these steps to ensure a high-quality and complete resolution:

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Understand the Issue**

   - Carefully read the GitHub issue assigned to you.
   - Take note of the problem statement, feature description, acceptance criteria, labels, and any attached references.
   - Ensure you understand the scope, dependencies, and expected behavior.
   - If anything is unclear, ask in the chat before implementing changes and wait for human to answer.

2. **Plan the Implementation**

   - Break the work into small, manageable tasks.
   - Outline the design or logic changes needed.
   - Update or add unit tests (if required).
   - Keep the projectâ€™s architecture, coding style, and conventions in mind as you plan.
   - Always check the latest documentation.
   - Make sure you are using the latest technology.

3. **Implement the Solution**

   - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
   - Follow naming conventions and formatting standards.
   - Keep changes scoped and minimal; avoid unrelated modifications.
   - Add or update automated tests where applicable.

4. **Test Your Work**

   - Run all existing tests to confirm no problem has been introduced.
   - Manually test the feature or fix to verify correctness.
   - Ensure cross-browser or cross-device compatibility if relevant.

Be thoughtful and rigorous in your work. Your contribution helps maintain the quality and functionality of the project.
